# Codepen Portfolio

A showcase of my projects from Intro to Computer Science A in the form of a static Jekyll site hosted on Github Pages that automatically downloads all the codepens from my account using my [cpen module](https://github.com/kajchang/CodePen-Downloader) and then builds index.md using jinja2 templates.
